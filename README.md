## Technologies Used

- **Flutter**: Flutter is a UI toolkit for building natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.

- **Dart**: Dart is the programming language used by Flutter to build applications.

- **FastAPI**: FastAPI is used for building the backend of the application, providing APIs for user authentication, problem sets, progress tracking, and more.

- **GetX**: GetX is utilized for state management in the Flutter app, making it easier to handle and update the application's state.
