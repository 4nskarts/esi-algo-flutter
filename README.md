# ESI Algo Flutter

Welcome to my first Flutter application - a collection of solutions to Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems! ðŸš€

## Overview

This repository is a playground for exploring Dart and Flutter while tackling various DSA challenges. The code is not polished, and it's far from professional, but it represents my learning journey in the world of mobile app development.

## Features

- **Algorithm Solutions:** Browse through the source code to find my attempts at solving DSA problems.
- **Flutter Exploration:** Witness my learning process with Flutter as I experiment with widgets and app development concepts.
- **Work in Progress:** Expect messy code, rookie mistakes, and frequent updates as I navigate the world of Dart and Flutter.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into this repository, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Flutter SDK](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
- Your favorite code editor (I use Visual Studio Code)

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/4nskarts/esi-algo-flutter.git
   ```

2. Open the project in your preferred Flutter-compatible IDE.

3. Run the app on an emulator or physical device.
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

4. Explore the code, try to understand my solutions, and feel free to suggest improvements or share your own DSA solutions!

## Contributions

This repository is a personal learning project, but I welcome contributions, suggestions, and friendly discussions. If you have a better way of solving a problem or want to add features, open an issue or submit a pull request.

## Disclaimer

This is my first attempt at Flutter, and the code may not follow best practices. I'm here to learn, so any feedback is highly appreciated!

Happy coding! ðŸš€
